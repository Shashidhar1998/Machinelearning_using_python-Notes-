for book in library:
    print(book) for whole tuple or 
    print(f"Author is {book[0]}") for index
    
for Author,Topic,Pages in library:
    print(f"Author is {Author}")
    
for Author,Topic,Pages in library:
    print(f"{Author:{10}} {Topic:{30}}  {Pages:>{10}}")  for text formatting like Topic takes 10 spaces 


date Formatting

---------------------------------WORKING ON TEXT FILES:-----------------
It works only in jupyter notes(%%writefile test.txt)
it creates the file named test.txt 
%%writefile test.txt
This the text file.
This is the second line in text file.

myfile = open('text.txt') //add the path

to read the content of file

myfile.read()
if u try to  read again myfile.read()// will print nothing because the cursor is at end

to reset the cursor
myfile.seek(0)

mycontent = myfile.read()

to close file 
myfile.close()


open file as a context manager
with open('text.txt') as myfile:
     // myfile.readlines is used to storelines in list ex: ["This the text file.\n","This is the second line in text file."]
     content = myfile.readlines()  // do operations inside the block and you don't have to close the file if we use context manager
