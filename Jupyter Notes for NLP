For nLp in machine learning there are 6 tasks
     1.Tokenize
     using python
     
     //first import nltk(natural language tool Kit)
     
     import nltk
     
     //create sample_text
    text = "Mar had a little lamb. Her fleece was white as now"
     
     //import sentence and word tokenizers
     
     from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize , sent_tokenize
     
     sentences = word_tokenize(text) 
     
     //may cause eeror to solve  nltk.download('punkt') and run in jupyter notes
     
     //output ['Mar had a little lamb.', 'Her fleece was white as now'] when u print sentences
     words = sent_tokenize(text) //
     
     output  ['Mar', 'had', 'a', 'little', 'lamb', '.', 'Her', 'fleece', 'was', 'white', 'as', 'now']
      
      2. Remove stop words in text  (remove punctuations and words lik a has an and so on)
      
      import nltk
      nltk.download('stopwords')
     from  nltk.corpus import stopwords
     from string import punctuation
      customwords = set(stopwords.words('english') + list(punctuation))
      
      syntax is
      
      WordsWOStopwords = [words for words in word_tokenize(text) if words not in customwords]
      
      //  ['Mar', 'little', 'lamb', 'Her', 'fleece', 'white']
